# 🧵 YOLOv11 Fabric Defect Detection – Training Pipeline

This project provides a clean and modular pipeline for training a **YOLOv11 model** to detect fabric defects such as holes, stitches, seams, and more. The system is optimized for extensibility, reproducibility, and integration into real-world manufacturing environments.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd model_training/
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare Dataset

Ensure your dataset follows the YOLO format:
```
data/
├── train/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
├── valid/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
├── test/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
```

Update `configs/data.yaml` with:
- `train`, `val`, and `test` image paths
- `names`: list of defect class names

---

## 🏋️ Train the Model

Train the YOLOv11 model using the entry script:
```bash
python main.py
```

You can customize training behavior in:
- `configs/data.yaml` – Dataset structure and class names
- `configs/hyp.yaml` – Hyperparameters
- `configs/train.yaml` – (Optional) Custom training config

---

## 📊 Evaluate the Model

Use the notebook:
```bash
notebooks/model_eval.ipynb
```
To:
- Visualize predictions on test images
- Generate performance metrics (mAP, precision, recall)
- Plot confusion matrix

---

## 📦 Model Artifacts

- `models/yolov11n.pt` – Final/best model checkpoint
- `models/runs/` – YOLO experiment runs and training logs
- `yolov11_logs/` – WandB or TensorBoard logs

---

## ⚙️ Tools and Frameworks

- [YOLOv11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- PyTorch
